This scientific Python course was given first in June 2009 in Dakar
during the Python African Tour event (http://www.dakarlug.org/pat/, in
French) by Emmanuelle Gouillart. The emphasis was mostly put on Numpy as
the course lasted only one day.

It has been slightly modified since then to add an image processing
topic.
